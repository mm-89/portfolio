## Projects

### 📊 [Light Exposure Model](light-exposure-model)
**Description:** A computational model to estimate light exposure on surfaces or tissues, based on environmental and geometric parameters.  
**Repository:** [light-exposure-model](light-exposure-model)

---

### 👁️ [Ocular Irradiance Model](ocular-irradiance-model)
**Description:** A 3D Monte Carlo-based model to predict UV and visible light irradiance on ocular tissues, including physiological data integration.  
**Repository:** [ocular-irradiance-model](ocular-irradiance-model)

---

### 📸 [Pinhole Camera Project](pinhole-project)
**Description:** A full analog photography project. Build a functional pinhole camera, expose and develop large-format film, and create cyanotype prints.  
**Repository:** [pinhole-project](pinhole-project)  
**Gallery:** [📁 Images](pinhole-project/pictures/)  
**Full Technical Report:** [📄 PDF](pinhole-project/pinhole_camera.pdf)

### ✈️ [RC Aircraft Model](rc-aircraft-model)
**Description:** Simulation and modeling of remote-controlled aircraft dynamics, including aerodynamic analysis and flight stability.  
**Repository:** [rc-aircraft-model](rc-aircraft-model)

---

### 🌞 [Sundial Generator](sundial-generator)
**Description:** A script/tool to generate accurate sundial designs based on geographic location, time, and orientation.  
**Repository:** [sundial-generator](sundial-generator)

## 🔧 Notes
- Each project repository contains **documentation, images, and code**.  
- Some projects are **research-oriented**, others are **personal or experimental**.  
- Visual projects (like **pinhole-project** or **sundial-generator**) include **screenshots and gallery folders**.  
- All links are relative to the repository root for easy navigation.

## 💡 Tips for Browsing
- Use the **icons** to quickly identify project type.  
- Open the **Gallery or PDF links** for detailed visual or technical documentation.  
- Each project is independent, so feel free to clone or explore separately.

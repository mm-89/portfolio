# Pinhole Camera Project

This repository documents a personal experiment in fully analog photography: building a functional pinhole camera from scratch, exposing and developing large-format film, and producing a final cyanotype print.

🎯 ## Purpose

The goal of the project was to recreate the entire analog workflow without using any commercial camera parts:

- Hand-built wooden pinhole camera
- 5×7 inch film plate exposure
- Film development using Caffenol
- Final print using the cyanotype process

This project merges optics, chemistry, and craftsmanship to show how a simple aperture and controlled light can produce a real photographic image.

📐 ## Camera Design

- Format: 5×7 inch large format film
- Focal length: ~50 mm (wide-angle equivalent due to crop factor)
- Optimal pinhole diameter computed using Rayleigh’s formula:

    $$d = 1.41\sqrt{f\lambda}$$

- Resulting aperture: f/167
- Interchangeable aluminum pinhole plates
- Manual shutter with magnetic open/close positions

🎞 ## Film & Exposure

- Film: Fomapan 100 ISO [DATASHEET](https://www.digitaltruth.com/products/foma_tech/Fomapan_100.pdf)
- Exposure times strongly affected by the Schwarzschild effect
- Typical exposure in full sun: ~4 minutes

🧪 ## Development (Caffenol)

- Film was developed using an eco-friendly homemade developer based on:

- Instant coffee
- Sodium carbonate
- Vitamin C
- Negatives were processed at 20 °C with gentle agitation in a DIY darkroom.

🖨 ## Printing (Cyanotype)

The final print was created via the cyanotype process:

- Mixing ferric ammonium citrate + potassium ferricyanide
- Hand-coating watercolor paper
- Sunlight exposure (~13 minutes)
- Washing and hydrogen-peroxide bath
- 12-hour drying

📸 ## Result

The final cyanotype print and negatives are included in the repository (see the images/ folder).

🧭 ## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how minimal materials and basic physical principles can produce a complete photographic workflow—from optical design to chemical printing. It highlights the beauty and accessibility of analog photography, even in its simplest form.

# Flying Model Project ✈️

A homemade radio-controlled aircraft designed and built from scratch.  
This repository documents the entire design process: from aerodynamic calculations to the electronics and construction techniques used.

## Overview

This project was born out of curiosity and a passion for aviation. The goal: build a flyable RC airplane without using pre-made kits or copying existing models. All design choices — wing profile, tail sizing, motor, electronics — were guided by aeronautical references and adjusted to suit amateur-level materials and tools.
